<h1>Dear reader, welcome to my hobbies section!</h1>
<p>I have a very curious mind, and I get easily bored from doing things for too long. I enjoy a lot of variety and I feel good when I can try myself in new interesting activities. I have accumulated a lot of experiences in my 23 years and I attribute a large part of who I am to these hobbies that I cherish. Since a large number of activities that I enjoy are related to sports I am going to divide this section to sports and everything else.</p>

<p>The first sport that I played competitively was <em>basketball</em>. I joined my schoolâ€™s team in first grade and the sport has remained a part of my life for the last 15 years. Although I only trained for 3 years, I still enjoy going out there to play with my friends.</p>

<p>After I stopped playing basketball I picked up skiing as my next sport. I met the amazing team of K2 Freestyle SC on a ski trip to Austria, and they were very eager for me to join their team and begin going to their training camps. I spent four years with the team, representing them in over 15 competitions. I stopped skiing at the age of 13, when I moved to Ghana, and interestingly I have not been on skis ever since.</p>
