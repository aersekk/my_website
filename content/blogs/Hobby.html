<h1>Dear reader, welcome to my hobbies section!</h1>
<p>I have a very curious mind, and I get easily bored from doing things for too long. I enjoy a lot of variety and I feel good when I can try myself in new interesting activities. I have accumulated a lot of experiences in my 23 years and I attribute a large part of who I am to these hobbies that I cherish. Since a large number of activities that I enjoy are related to sports I am going to divide this section to sports and everything else.</p>

<p>The first sport that I played competitively was <em>basketball</em>. I joined my school’s team in first grade and the sport has remained a part of my life for the last 15 years. Although I only trained for 3 years, I still enjoy going out there to play with my friends.</p>

<p>After I stopped playing basketball I picked up skiing as my next sport. I met the amazing team of K2 Freestyle SC on a ski trip to Austria, and they were very eager for me to join their team and begin going to their training camps. I spent four years with the team, representing them in over 15 competitions. I stopped skiing at the age of 13, when I moved to Ghana, and interestingly I have not been on skis ever since.</p>

<p>In Ghana, my school had a seasonal rotation programme for sports, Term 1 had volleyball, Term 2 had basketball, and Term 3 had football, whilst swimming was all year round. I ended up playing basketball and volleyball during season times, but spent the majority of my time in the pool all year-round for 4 years, representing my school in a total of 6 international competitions. In my senior year I was even elected as co-captain of the swim-team, which ended up being a very rewarding year. My favourite stroke was butterfly, but I was the strongest at backstroke (which I hated).</p>

<p>Finally, running has been an all around classic sport. I started running in first grade, but never intended it as something I would compete in. I just simply had too much energy so i had to find a way to drain it. My first notable running event was when I unexpectedly placed 2nd in a Budapest wide 1km competition in 5th grade. The same year I placed 5th in a 3km uphill race. If I have to be honest I hated to run, but and I never actually trained for it, however, my PE teacher really liked me so she kept encouraging me to parttake in races. I never really pursued it as a competitive sport after 6th grade, but I was always the second fastest mile runner in my high school.</p>
<p>These days, when I am in Budapest, I really enjoy running around the Margaret Island’s 5km running track with the goregous view of the city. I frequently run here with my siblings, doing running drills and challenges to push ourselves.</p>
