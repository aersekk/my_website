# Dear reader, welcome to my hobbies section!

I have a very curious mind, and I get easily bored from doing things for too long. I enjoy a lot of variety and I feel good when I can try myself in new interesting activities. I have accumulated a lot of experiences in my 23 years and I attribute a large part of who I am to these hobbies that I cherish. Since a large number of activities that I enjoy are related to sports I am going to divide this section to sports and everything else.



## Sports

The first sport that I played competitively was *basketball*. I joined my school's team in first grade and the sport has remained a part of my life for the last 15 years. Although I only trained for 3 years, I still enjoy going out there to play with my friends.

After I stopped playing basketball I picked up skiing as my next sport. I met the amazing team of K2 Freestyle SC on a ski trip to Austria, and they were very eager for me to join their team and begin going to their training camps. I spent four years with the team, representing them in over 15 competitions. I stopped skiing at the age of 13, when I moved to Ghana, and interestingly I have not been on skis ever since.

In Ghana, my school had a seasonal rotation programme for sports, Term 1 was volleyball, Term 2 was basketball, and Term 3 was football, whilst swimming was all year round. I ended up playing basketball and volleyball during season times, but spent the majority of my time in the pool all year-round for 4 years, representing my school in a total of 6 international competitions. In my senior year I was even elected as co-captain of the swim-team, which ended up being a very rewarding year. My favourite stroke was butterfly, but I was the strongest at backstroke (which I hated).

Finally, running has been an all around classic sport. I started running in first grade, but never intended it as something I would compete in. I just simply had too much energy so i had to find a way to drain it. My first notable running event was when I unexpectedly placed 2nd in a Budapest wide 1km competition in 5th grade. The same year I placed 5th in a 3km uphill race. If I have to be honest I hated to run, but and I never actually trained for it, however, my PE teacher really liked me so she kept encouraging me to parttake in races. I never really pursued it as a competitive sport after 6th grade, but I was always the second fastest mile runner in my high school.

These days, when I am in Budapest, I really enjoy running around the Margaret Island's 5km running track with the goregous view of the city. I frequently run here with my siblings, doing running drills and challenges to push ourselves.


## Other hobbies

One of my earliest hobbies that I remember doing was building train track mock-ups every Sunday morning with my father. When I was young I was gifted multiple sets of toy train tracks and electric train engines that one could put together to form loops with bridges, tunnels, and other elements one could assemble in any order. And every Sunday morning I would wake up and build a long track around my house with my father, always different, always more daring. I was very impressed by trains during that period for some reason, and I also frequently walked to the local train station with my grandma to watch trains go by. 

Growing up I played a lot of video games. I was almost always in front of the computer playing some sort of multi-player online game with my friends. I lost this habit in the last 5 years, however, videogames have remained a cherished way of passing my downtime, relaxing from a stressful day, or to just spend some time with my friends. It has been a great asset to my social life during the 2020 and 2021, as the current situation did not allow for social gatherings. Instead, all my friends would log online and spend a couple of hours playing videogames whilst having a nice conversation.

Another hobby that recently picked up is learning the Rubik's Cube. The Rubik's Cube is a Hungarian invention, so I felt very ashamed when at the age of 22 I was the only one in the office out of 8 people who could not solve it. I was very determined to start learning, and it quickly became a habit. It is very easy to pick it up, sping it around, do one or two quick solves and then move on with your day, or sit down for a prolonger period of time and try to beat your fastest solve time.

Finally, I love to read. Agatha Christie's murder mysteries are my all time favourites, although I am always glad to read a good book, whether it is fiction, science, or literature.
