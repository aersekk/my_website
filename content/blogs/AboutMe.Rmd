# Mini biography

## intro
 
My name is Akos Ersek and I was born on July 12th, 1998 in Budapest, Hungary, the city known best for its Parliament.

I consider myself to be a curious-minded person, full of energy and ambition. I am always doing something, and I am hardly ever inside my house. I love finding new adventures and trying new things. Two things that I like to do most: to travel and to move. Throughout my life I was fortunate to be able to visit over 40 countries and to live in 4 different countries by the age of 21. How I managed to do all of this is a long story that I will try to summarise below.

## My early years

I actually grew up in a small town next to Budapest where I spent the first 10 years of my life. I attended  an elementary school called Huzella Tivadar √Åltalanos Iskola, named after a famous Hungarian Biologist and Reseracher.

I started learning English and doing sports early on, which lead me to try a lot of interesting sports throughout my life. These include:

1. Basketball
2. Skiing
3. Swimming
4. Track & field
5. Handball
6. Golf
    
quite the range of sports.

### Academics

Throughout my life I attended a total of 2 elementary schools, 2 secondary schools, and 3 universities. I was fortunate enough to be able to move around quite often, meeting new people, and learn about exciting things. I was always very eager to learn, so constantly moving around played hand-in-hand with my interests. 

My life came to a sudden change when at the age of 13 my family moved to Ghana, and suddenly I found myself on a different continent, in a different city, a different school, and a completely different environment.

I studied in an international educational system from the age of 14-18, which allowed me to study interesting subjects such as Economics, Global Politics, and Media & Design.

To close this chapter, heres a gorgeous picture of the swimming pool I spent 3 of my mornings almost every week for 3.5 years.

#### University

I completed my bachelors at Warwick Business School where I studied Management with a specialization in Finance. Whilst here, I was part of Warwick Congress' Careers & Sponsorship team for 2 years, pitching corporate partnerships to financial and non-financial sponsors. The society organised academic talks, workshops, company presentations and a conference to students of the university, hoping to bridge the gap between finance, law, politics and econimcs in academia.

Despite being finance-focused I still enjoy learning about *astrology*, *physics*, or *medicine*, for example. My general curiosity drives me forward every day and makes me motivated to undertake new experiences, and it is one of the main reasons I am at LBS today.

### Future

Currently, I am completing my master's degree at [LBS](https://www.london.edu). I hope to remain part of the amazing community at *London Business School*, and achieve great things that are yet to come.
