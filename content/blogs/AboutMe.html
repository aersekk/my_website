<h1>Mini biography</h1>
<div id="intro" class="section level2">
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>My name is Akos Ersek and I was born on July 12th, 1998 in Budapest, Hungary, the city known best for its Parliament.</p>

<p>I consider myself to be a curious-minded person, full of energy and ambition. I am always doing something, and I am hardly ever inside my house. I love finding new adventures and trying new things. Two things that I like to do most: to travel and to move. Throughout my life I was fortunate to be able to visit over 40 countries and to live in 4 different countries by the age of 21. How I managed to do all of this is a long story that I will try to summarise below.</p>

<div id="my-early-years" class="section level2">
<h2>My early years</h2>
<p>I actually grew up in a small town next to Budapest where I spent the first 10 years of my life. I attended an elementary school called Huzella Tivadar Általanos Iskola, named after a famous Hungarian Biologist and Reseracher.</p>

<p>I started learning English and doing sports early on, which lead me to try a lot of interesting sports throughout my life. These include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Basketball</li>
<li>Skiing</li>
<li>Swimming</li>
<li>Track &amp; field</li>
<li>Handball</li>
<li>Golf</li>
</ol>
<p>quite the range of sports.</p>

<h3>Academics</h3>
<p>Throughout my life I attended a total of 2 elementary schools, 2 secondary schools, and 3 universities. I was fortunate enough to be able to move around quite often, meeting new people, and learn about exciting things. I was always very eager to learn, so constantly moving around played hand-in-hand with my interests.</p>
<p>My life came to a sudden change when at the age of 13 my family moved to Ghana, and suddenly I found myself on a different continent, in a different city, a different school, and a completely different environment.</p>
<p>I studied in an international educational system from the age of 14-18, which allowed me to study interesting subjects such as Economics, Global Politics, and Media &amp; Design.</p>
To close this chapter, heres a gorgeous picture of the swimming pool I spent 3 of my mornings almost every week for 3.5 years.

<h4>University</h4>
<p>I completed my bachelors at Warwick Business School where I studied Management with a specialization in Finance. Whilst here, I was part of Warwick Congress’ Careers &amp; Sponsorship team for 2 years, pitching corporate partnerships to financial and non-financial sponsors. The society organised academic talks, workshops, company presentations and a conference to students of the university, hoping to bridge the gap between finance, law, politics and econimcs in academia.</p>

<p>Despite being finance-focused I still enjoy learning about <em>astrology</em>, <em>physics</em>, or <em>medicine</em>, for example. My general curiosity drives me forward every day and makes me motivated to undertake new experiences, and it is one of the main reasons I am at LBS today.</p>
