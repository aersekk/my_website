2. Warwick Business School

I completed my Bachelors at Warwick Business School studying Bsc Management with Finance. I was able to graduate with a First Class Honours degree classificant across the four years. Apart from academics I was able to immerse myself in the student life by participating in multiple societies, such as being part of Warwick Congress's Careers & Sponsorship team.

3. Universitat Pompeu Fabra

Whilst at WBS, I was able to complete an exchange year at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, in Barcelona, Spain. There, I was a part of the Business and Economic Sciences Department. During my year at UPF, I successfully joined the competitive student run investment club of the university, and travelled to many places around Catalonia.

4. Lincoln Community School

I went to an American International School called Lincoln Community School during grades 9-12 in Accra, Ghana. I developed a large part of who I am today during these four years. I traveled to 15 different African countries, represented my school in 4 different international swimming competitions, and actively volunteered with local special schools and orphanages amongst many other things.

5. Budapesti Fazekas Mihály Ált. Isk. és Gim.

I attended the strongest secondary school of Hungary for grades 7 and 8. Here I was studying amongst some of the brighest young minds in Hungary. And interesting fact is that I never stopped attending this secondary school after moving to Ghana. I completed all 12 grades in the hungarian educational system, as well as abroad, as a home schooled student.
