# Dear Reader

## Welcome to a quick summary of my early years, very exciting times.
 
I was born in **Hungary**, the country mainly known for its [Goulash soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulash), and the gorgeous Parliament.

I actually grew up in a small town next to Budapest where I spent the first 10 years of my life. I attended  an elementary school called Huzella Tivadar Általanos Iskola, named after a famous Hungarian Biologist and Reseracher.

I started learning English and doing sports early on, which lead me to try a lot of interesting sports throughout my life. These include:

    1. Basketball
    2. Skiing
    3. Swimming
    4. Track & field
    5. Handball
    6. Golf
    
quite the range of sports.

### Academics

On the academic side, I was always very eager to learn new things. Despite being finance-focused I still enjoy learning about *astrology*, *physics*, or *medicine*, for example. My general curiosity drives me forward every day and makes me motivated to undertake new experiences, and it is one of the main reasons I am at LBS today.

### Future

Currently, I am completing my master's degree at [LBS](https://www.london.edu), despite only being 5 days into the program. I hope to remain part of the amazing community at *London Business School*, and achieve great things that are yet to come.
