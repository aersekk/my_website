<p>On this page I present my education history in chronological order, starting from most recent.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>London Business School</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently I am attending London Business School’s Masters in Financial Analysis programme, with an expected graduation date of July 2022. My subjects include, but are not limited to: Corporate Finance, Securities Valuation and Financial Modelling, and Distressed Investing among others.</p>
<p><img src="/img/WBS_Resized.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Warwick Business School</li>
</ol>
<p>I completed my Bachelors at Warwick Business School studying Bsc Management with Finance. I was able to graduate with a First Class Honours degree classificant across the four years. Apart from academics I was able to immerse myself in the student life by participating in multiple societies, such as being part of Warwick Congress’s Careers &amp; Sponsorship team.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Logo_UPF.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Universitat Pompeu Fabra</li>
</ol>
<p>Whilst at WBS, I was able to complete an exchange year at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, in Barcelona, Spain. There, I was a part of the Business and Economic Sciences Department. During my year at UPF, I successfully joined the competitive student run investment club of the university, and travelled to many places around Catalonia.</p>
<p><img src="/img/LCS.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Lincoln Community School</li>
</ol>
<p>I went to an American International School called Lincoln Community School during grades 9-12 in Accra, Ghana. I developed a large part of who I am today during these four years. I traveled to 15 different African countries, represented my school in 4 different international swimming competitions, and actively volunteered with local special schools and orphanages amongst many other things.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Fazekas.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Budapesti Fazekas Mihály Ált. Isk. és Gim.</li>
</ol>
<p>I attended the strongest secondary school of Hungary for grades 7 and 8. Here I was studying amongst some of the brighest young minds in Hungary. And interesting fact is that I never stopped attending this secondary school after moving to Ghana. I completed all 12 grades in the hungarian educational system, as well as abroad, as a home schooled student.</p>
